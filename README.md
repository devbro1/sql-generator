# sql-generator

> [!CAUTION]
> Still in Alpha. Not good for production yet!!! I expect various things to change

Inspired by laravel, this is my attempt to create a create an ORM for javascript and nodejs that has all the features.

for documentation please check [documentations](https://devbro1.github.io/sql-generator/)


## Quick Example

```javascript
import { Query } from "@devbro1/sql-generator";

let query = new Query({
  client: "postgresql",
  connection: {
    host: "my.database-server.com",
    port: 5432,
    database: "database-name",
    user: "database-user",
    password: "secretpassword!!",
  },
});

const qb = query
      .select(["product_id", query.raw("SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity")])
      .from("sales")
      .where("col1", "=", "value")
      .orWhere("col2", "=", "value2")
      .groupBy(query.raw("product_id"));

console.log(qb.toFullSQL());
const result = await qb.get();

console.log(result);
```

## Some mentality about this code conversion
### No Null when possible
having to deal with random types is annoying and Null is one of those values that can complicate matters more. I have decided to avoid using Null or Undefined types whenever possible. I understand there are situations that requires defining a default object is not easy but I will try to address them as I continue on this project.
